1. Write a song about New York
The towers reach up to the skies
As the people below hurriedly pass by
The streets are alive, day and night
With the hustle and bustle of city life
The lights of Broadway shine so bright
Full of music, dance, and delight
In the Big Apple, there's so much to explore


In this concrete jungle I adore 


2. Write a song about New York
 The city wakes before the sun,
As trains rumble underground
Yellow cabs race down busy streets
That stretch on for miles it seems
Sirens wail throughout the night
Below towering lights shining bright
New York, New York - the city that never sleeps
With dreams and schemes conceived on crowded streets
Buildings rise up tall as trees
Filled with hopes, ambitions and memories
New York, New York - as tough as concrete
Still it pulses with a diverse heartbeat


3. Write a song about New York
Lights, camera, action - welcome to New York
The city of dreams, where stars are born
From Broadway stages to movie screens
You can become whatever you want to be
The Statue of Liberty stands tall
Welcoming one and welcomes all
To a city of towers reaching the clouds
Where you can shout your dreams out loud
The hot dog carts bring that street meat smell
While music floats through the subway wells
Yellow taxis zoom down the streets
As the heartbeat of the city never misses a beat
New York, New York - one of a kind
Where you can lose yourself and find
A place where your dreams are never too big
In the city of lights and the city that never sleeps
